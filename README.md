üõ† Installing Node.js

This project uses Node.js to manage dependencies and run the development server.

1. Check if Node.js is installed

Open a terminal and run:

```bash
node -v
npm -v
```

If you see version numbers (e.g., v20.11.1 and 10.5.0), you already have Node.js and npm installed.

2. Install Node.js

If Node.js is not installed:
	‚Ä¢	Recommended: Install the LTS (Long Term Support) version from the official Node.js website[https://nodejs.org/en/].
	‚Ä¢	Choose LTS, not Current.
	‚Ä¢	Download the installer for your system (Windows, macOS, Linux).
	‚Ä¢	Run the installer and follow the prompts.
	‚Ä¢	macOS with Homebrew (alternative):

brew install node


	‚Ä¢	Linux (Debian/Ubuntu):

sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y nodejs npm

(Or use nvm for more flexibility.)

3. Verify installation

After installation, close and reopen your terminal, then run:

node -v
npm -v

You should now see valid version numbers.

‚∏ª

‚úÖ That‚Äôs it! You‚Äôre ready to install dependencies with:

npm install

and start the development server with:

npm run dev

Would you like me to also add a troubleshooting section (e.g., fixing ‚Äúcommand not found‚Äù or using nvm for version management) so your README is foolproof for students?
